Well, experts would suggest that there
are something on the order of 10 to the 123 different
possible chess games.
That's a really big number.
And in fact, there are only about 10
to the 80th atoms in the observable universe.
So there's no way that we can store all of that information
away.

And what Turing showed is if you have six operations.
And those are move left, move right, scan, print, write, do nothing.
With just those six primitives, you
can compute anything that's computable.

But nonetheless, anything you can compute in one language,
you can compute in any other language,
and this is a property called Turing complete.
It's one of the fundamentals of computer science.

str.swapcase()
Return *a copy of* the string with uppercase characters converted to lowercase and vice versa. Note that it is not necessarily true that s.swapcase().swapcase() == s.

str.find(sub[, start[, end]])
Return the lowest index in the string where substring sub is found within the slice s[start:end]. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation. Return -1 if sub is not found.

str.index(sub[, start[, end]])
Like find(), but raise ValueError when the substring is not found.
